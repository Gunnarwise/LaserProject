<h1>Tracking selected color in real time using OpenCV. </h1>>
This project uses OpenCV to track colors in real time. This is a smaller project that will come together in a group project in order to pop balloons with a laser.
The final project will use two cameras attached to a Rasberry Pi to track the objects, which will then talk to an Arduino to move a laser with mirror galvanometers
to accurately and speedily aim at the object, then turn the laser on.
